                The Universe, one of the grandest designs and full of mystories.
                The discovery of expanding universe is one of the greatest
                intellectual revolutions of twentieth century. So let's discuss
                more deeply about this expanding universe.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the beggining days of our understanding about universe we
                think that the planet Earth was in center and all the other
                planets are revolving with respect to Earth. Later we realised
                that It's not the case and if fact all the planets in our solar
                system are revolving with respect to an nearest star named Sun.
                Later along with our sun and other nearby stars are all part of
                a vast collection named the Milky way. For a long time we
                thought that this was the whole universe untill Edwin Hubble
                demonstrated that ours was not only the galaxy. There were in
                fact many others are there with billions of stars in it. And
                like that ideas about infinate universe are born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Edwin Hubble made a huge contribution in our understanding about
                the universe. So let's discuss about discoveries. Let's start
                about his discovery of other galaxies. To prove this he needed
                to calculate the distance between these galaxies. We all know
                that the distance between our sun and earth was calculated by
                observing how it changed it's position as earth goes around it.
                But the stars in other galaxies are so far away. So Hubble was
                forced to use indirect methods to calculate these distances. One
                way to calculate the distance is, the brightness of a star
                depends on two factors luminosity and how far it is from. For
                nearby stars we can measure both it's apparent brightness and
                distance, so we can work out their luminosity. Conversly, if we
                knew the luminosity of stars in other galaxies, we could work
                out it's distance by measuring it's apparant brightness. Hubble
                argued that there were certain types of stars in each galaxy
                which has same luminosity. So when we are near to it, we can calculate
                the distance. Like this he calculated the distance to nine
                different galaxies.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know that our galaxy is only one of some million billion out
                there that we can see using our modren telescopes. Each galaxy
                itself has some million million stars. We live in a spiral
                galaxy that is about one hundred thousand light years across and
                is slowly rotating. Our sun is just an "ordinary averaged-sized
                yellow star" near outer edge of one of the spiral arms. So how
                can we differntiate stars apart?? These stars are so far away
                that they apper as pin points of light. There is only one
                characteristic feature that we can observe, "the color of their
                light". Newton discovered that if light from the sun passes
                through a prism, it breaks up into its component colors, its
                spectrum like in a rainbow. By focusing a telescope on an
                individual star or galaxy, one can similarly observe the
                spectrum of the light from that star or galaxy. Different stars
                have different spectra, but the relative brightness of the
                different colors is always exactly what one would expect to find
                in the light emitted by an object that is glowing red hot. This
                means that we can tell a star's temperature from the spectrum of
                its light. Moreover, we find that certain very specific colors
                are missing from stars’ spectra, and these missing colors may
                vary from star to star. We know that each chemical element
                absorbs the characteristic set of very specific colors. Thus, by
                matching each of those which are missing from a star’s spectrum,
                we can determine exactly which elements are present in the
                star’s atmosphere. In the 1920s, when astronomers began to look
                at the spectra of stars in other galaxies, they found something
                most peculiar: There were the same characteristic sets of
                missing colors as for stars in our own galaxy, but they were all
                shifted by the same relative amount toward the red end of the
                spectrum. The only reasonable explanation of this was that the
                galaxies were moving away from us, and the frequency of the
                light waves from them was being reduced, or red-shifted, by the
                Doppler effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1929 Hubble published that each and every single galaxy was moving
                away from us and the resultant red-shift was not random, it is
                praportional to the galaxy's diatance from us. If universe was
                expanding fairly slowly, the force of gravity would cause it
                eventually to stop expanding and then to start contracting.
                However, if it was expanding at more than a certain critical
                rate, gravity would never be strong enough to stop it, and the
                universe would continue to expand forever. This is a bit like
                what happens when one fires a rocket upward from the surface of
                the Earth. Even when Einstein formulated the general theory of
                relativity in 1915, he was sure that the universe had to be
                static. He therefore modified his theory to make this possible,
                introducing a socalled cosmological constant into his equations.
                This was a new “antigravity” force, which, unlike other forces,
                did not come from any particular source, but was built into the
                very fabric of space-time. His cosmological constant gave
                space-time an inbuilt tendency to expand, and this could be made
                to exactly balance the attraction of all the matter in the
                universe so that a static universe would result.

                Only one man Alexander Friedmann was willing to explain this. In
                fact, in 1922, several years before Edwin Hubble's discovery,
                Friedmann predicted exactly what Hubble found. He made two very
                simple assumptions about the universe: that the universe looks
                identical in whichever direction we look, and that this would
                also be true if we were observing the universe from anywhere
                else. The first assumption is not entirely true because the
                other stars in our galaxy form a distinct band of light across
                the night sky called the Milky Way. However if we look at
                distant galaxies, there seems to be same number of galaxies in
                each direction. For a long time this was just an rough
                assumption of actual universe untill in 1965, two American
                physicists, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, were working at the
                Bell Labs on the design of a very sensitive microwave detector
                for communicating with orbiting satellites. They were worried
                that their detector was picking up more noise than it ought to,
                and that the noise did not appear to be coming from any
                particular direction. First they looked for bird droppings on
                their detector and checked for other possible malfunctions but
                it's not the case. So they realized that this extra noise was
                comming from outside the atmosphere may be beyond our solar
                syatem or galaxy otherwise it would wary when they changed their
                detector position.
              </p>
              <p>
                They concluded that Friedmann's prediction was correct. If the
                universe is expanding then at some point all the matter that you
                see out there has to be started from a infitisimaly small point
                [ later given the name Big Bang to describe ]. Therfore we can
                still see the light from the big bang but it's greately red
                shifted because of expansion, seems like microwave radiation.
                For this, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize in
                1978.

                I believe this is enough to prove that our universe is really
                expanding. Since we now confirmed that our universe is
                expanding, then another question arises i.e., it is expanding
                into what??? The answer to this question is that the universe
                isn’t expanding into anything. It is just that the distance
                between galaxies is increasing continuously. The galaxies are
                relatively still but the space between them is moving. To
                understand this let's assume that we have an imaginary tape
                which we will use to measure the distance. If we stretch that
                tape between two different galaxies, assume that the reading is
                400 million miles. If we leave the tape like that for some
                years, if the galaxies are moving then the measure on the tape
                has to change. But this is not the case, since the space is
                moving [ stretching ], the tape stretchs. Hence, we can say that
