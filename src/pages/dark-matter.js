              <p>
                As most of you known the dark matter makes about 80% mass of the
                universe that we see today. If this calculations are proper then
                it's like if our solar system has a mass of our planet earth
                then the resultant dark matter mass would be 2 million times the
                mass of our earth. Now let's stop for a movement and try to
                grasp these huge numbers by shouting WTF?? But good thing is
                this dark matter is not same as the matter that we regularly see
                and this matter wouldn't exibit the same properties of normal
                matter and all the dark matter is hidden in the vastness of
                space-time. So now it's time to dive deep into this wierd matter
                that we don't know.
              </p>
              <p>
                And now let me start this with gravity and matter, the two
                fundamental forces of our nature that we interact everyday. The
                term gravity has so much more than what we know. However some of
                the brilliant minds of our race like Newton and Einstein tried
                to explain it and they never failed. To put their theories
                simply any mass particle will exibit gravity around it and these
                scientists tried to explain their behaviour.

                In 1937 an swiss-american astrophysisit Fritz Zwicky was
                examining the Coma cluster about 300 million light years away
                which has thousands of rich galaxies in it. He studied the
                indevedual galaxies and calculated the average velocity of coma
                cluster and surprisingly the value is so huge. Although Coma
                ranks among the largest and most massive clusters in the
                universe, it does not contain enough visible galaxies to account
                for the observed speeds Zwicky measured. To make things worse
                Newton said that the velocities of planets that revolves around
                the sun, if we increase their velocity to double, theses planets
                would leave our solar system leaving their orbits. He called
                this as "escape velocity". But according to Zwicky calculations
                of Coma cluster their average velocity is so huge than the
                escape velocity . If so then the coma cluster has to swift fly
                away in few hundred years. But the cluster is more than ten
                billion years old, which is nearly as old as the universe
                itself. And so was born what remains the longest-standing
                unsolved mystery in astrophysics.
              </p>
              <p>
                In next decade the several clusters exhibited same velocities
                like the coma cluster.Then what or who should we blame? Newton?
                I wouldn’t. Not just yet. His theories had been examined for 250
                years and passed all tests. And so scientists have realised that
                the coma cluster has a imaginary mass that binds the indevedual
                coma's clusters, but it is in unknown visible from and it
                doesn't has same properties as a normal mass if so we would've
                discovered it. "Scientists've been waiting nearly a century for
                somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force
                that we’ve measured in the universe about eighty-five percent of
                it arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with
                “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn’t come
                from matter and energy at all."
              </p>
              <p>
                After that we have settled on a term "dark matter" to describe
                this. As some of scientists believing the existing of dark
                matter, an astrophysisit named Vera Rubin calculated the speeds
                at which the stars orbits around their galaxies. She found that
                the stars on the edges have more velocities compared to the ones
                near to the center of a galaxy. Rubin correctly reasoned that it
                is obvious that these dark matter regions are present between
                galaxies i.e., they are in void between two galaxies and because
                of that the stars on edges moving faster.

                This is explanation given by{" "}

                regarding to dark matter. "" Hydrogen and helium are the basic
                elements of our universe. In the early beggining of universe
                thermonuclear fusion is common thing. Each fusion reaction will
                result in one helium atom for ten hydrogen atoms. If dark matter
                participated in nuclear fusion then there would be more helium
                atoms compared to hydrogen in universe. Form this we can
                conclude that most of the mass in the universe does not
                participate in nuclear fusion, which disqualifies it as ordinary
                matter, whose essence lies in a willingness to participate in
                the atomic and nuclear forces that shape matter as we know it.
                Detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background, which
                allow a separate test of this conclusion, verify the result:
                Dark matter and nuclear fusion don’t mix.""

                Now let's stop for movement and try to understand what he
                actually trying to say. In our universe 80% of the gravitational
                waves are not from the things that we can see. So the correct
                labelling for this is Dark gravity instead of dark matter
                beacuse matter is the thing that we know and dark gravity is
                nothing like that. Now you can ask does dark gravity exists?
                Yeah 80% of it is there in a form that we don't know. So we
                really should call it as dark gravity. Another thing that he
                said is, these dark matter particles don't interact with any
                other family of particles that we are aware of. If so we would
                have discovered it by now. One compelling feature about dark
                matter is " it won't even interact with itself ". To understand
                this let me give an example, if you observed a rock, it's a
                combination of several atoms that interacted with one another or
                itself at molecular scale by electromagnetic forces to form a
                solid shape that we call as rock. So if it interacted with
                itself then it allows you to accumulate huge concentration of
                matter from one place than the other. If this has happened then
                we would have dark matter planets, galaxies and so on. So we can
                conclude that dark matter don't interact with us or itself and
                that's why it is spred out across the universe rather than
                concentrated over a particular region.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus I can say that dark matter doesn’t simply consist of matter
                that happens to be dark. Instead, it’s something else
                altogether. So now we can say that it excerts gravity same as an
                ordinary matter but it doesn't obeys the other laws that
                ordinary matter obeys if so we would've discovered it.

                To sum this up all I can say is{" "}

                  if mass has gravity then all the gravity has mass??? I don't
                  know Maybe there’s nothing wrong with the matter, and it’s the
                  gravity that we don’t understand.{" "}
