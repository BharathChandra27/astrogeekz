              <p>
                Here in this article I'll try explain the theories and equations
                given by an outstanding genius in our human race named{" "}
                <span style={{ color: " #5d6d7e " }}> Albert Einstein. </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Einstein spent most of his life trying to understand the
                universe. He has given equations and theories which solved most
                of the questions about our universe. So let's discuss about it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'll start with Einstein's most famous equations e=mc2. This
                equation is called energy mass equivalence equation. This
                equation says that energy and mass are same but two different
                quantities more like a two faces of a coin. He says that mass
                can be converted to energy and vice versa. However this
                conversion is not always 100% because some amount of energy is
                lost during this process. Full conversion is possible only with
                the involvement of anti-matter. As a side note anti-matter is
                nothing but matter with opposite properties of normal matter.
                Every sub atomic particle has another particle with opposite
                properties. Like electron - anti electron, proton - antiproton,
                hydrogen - anti hydrogen and so on. Comming back to our
                conversation like I said reaction between hydrogen and anti
                hydrogen can satisfy the above equation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another thing this equation says is nothing may travel faster
                than the speed of light. Because of the equivalence of energy
                and mass, the energy which an object has due to its motion will
                add to its mass. In other words, it will make it harder to
                increase its speed. This effect is only really significant for
                objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light. For
                example, at 10 percent of the speed of light an object’s mass is
                only 0.5 percent more than normal, while at 90 percent of
                thespeed of light it would be more than twice it normal mass. As
                an object approaches the speed of light, its mass rises ever
                more quickly, so it takes more and more energy to speed it up
                further. It can in fact never reach thespeed of light, because
                by then its mass would have become infinite, and by the
                equivalence of mass and energy, it would have taken an infinite
                amount of energy to get it there. For this reason, any normal
                object is forever confined by relativity to move at speeds
                slower than the speed of light. Only light, or other waves
                thathave no intrinsic mass, can move at the speed of light.
              </p>
              <p>
                And now let's discuss about his theories of relativities. In
                1905 Einstein introduced his theory of special relativity. In
                this theory he said that for every event in space we may
                construct a light cone. A light cone is nothing but
                representation of past and future. According to Maxwell's
                equations we know that light travels at a constant speed and it
                doesn't depend on speed of host or medium. Moreover the
                properties of light doesn't change. And now we know that it
                takes around 8min for a light ray to reach earth. It means that
                what we are seeing is past version of sun because by the time we
                see it it's already 8min in future. So if we summarise these
                ideas we can construct a light cone. A light cone has two
                indevedual cones one represents past and one for future and
                present is intersection of tip's of two light cones. He Said
                that we can predict what may happen in future cone because the
                properties of light doesn't change.

              <p>
                One more thing that he said in this theory was time is not a
                static quantity and he introduced space-time. Space-time is
                nothing but mathematical model which fuses the three dimensions
                of space and the one dimension of time into a single
                four-dimensional continuum.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                However the special theory of relativity was very successful in
                explaining that the speed of light appears the same to all
                observers and in describing what happens when things move at
                speeds close to the speed of light. However, it was inconsistent
                with the Newtonian theory of gravity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, in 1915, he proposed what we now call the general
                theory of relativity. Einstein made the revolutionary suggestion
                that gravity is not a force like other forces, but is a
                consequence of the fact that space-time is not flat, as had been
                previously it is curved, or “warped,” by the distribution of
                mass and energy in it. To put it simply it means that heavier
                objects like sun or earth will bend or wrap the space time.
                Since we are curving the space time, we don't experience gravity
                since we are in free fall. To put it simply a freely falling
                body don't experience any gravity because there is no force
                opposing it's mass.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                The mass of sun is wrapping the space-time so much that even
                though the earth is travelling in straight line it appears as it
                is curved. To understand this let's assume that a plane is
                travelling in straightforward above earth, now if you see it's
                shadow it looks like curved path because of curvature of earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fact that space is curved means that light nolonger appears
                to travel in straight lines in space. So general relativity
                predicts that light should be bent by gravitational fields. For
                example, the theory predicts that the light cones of points near
                the sun would be slightly bent inward, on account of the mass of
                the sun. This means that light from a distant star that happened
                to pass near the sun would be deflected through a small angle,
                causing the star to appear in a different position to an
                observer on the earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another prediction of general relativity is that time should
                appear to slower near a massive body like the earth. This is
                because there is a relation between the energy of light and its
                frequency (that is, the number of waves of light per second),
                the greater the energy, the higher frequency. As light travels
                upward in the earth’sgravitational field, it loses energy, and
                so its frequency goes down. (This means that the length of time
                between one wave crest and the next goes up.) To someone high
                up, it would appear that everything down below was making longer
                to happen.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Einstein another discovery was Einstein-Rosen bridge, now what
                we call as warmhole. He suggested that because of these
                distortions in space time fabric, there is a possibility that
                there may be connection between two different areas of space
                through these distortions. To put it simply a warmhole is
                nothing but a bridge between two different points in space. For
                this to happen we need two conditions. One is a warmhole must
                not have a event horizon and second is there must be an infinite
                mass exerting on a infrticimal small point called singularity.
                The second one leads us to another discovery Black holes.
              </p>
              <p>
                However these warmholes are not stable because the gravity wants
                to close them. One way of maintaining a warmhole open is by
                using exotic matter. We know everything in our universe is
                attracted to one another because of gravity. Now these exotic
                matter is complete opposite. It exibit repulsive forces to keep
                things at a distance. Most people thinks that anti matter and
                exotic matter are same. No it's not.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another interesting discovery in his theory of relativity was
                black holes. He suggested that since there's a distortion in
                spacetime, there may be areas where heavier amounts of mass is
                concentrated on very small point (singularity) wrapping the
                space time so high and as a result it may have very high
                gravitational pull so much that not even light can't escape from
                it's pull. To understand black holes numerically, if our planet
                earth wants to become a black hole then it's 13 billion trillion
                tons of it's weight has to be concentrated on a point of size
                between 8-10mm.
